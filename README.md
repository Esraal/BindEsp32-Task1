# BindEsp32-Task1

steps to bind the esp32 with the computer:
The first step is to connect the esp32 piece to the USB port.
In the second step we will look for the esp32 segment inside the libraries in the Arduino environment and we will extract the esp32 folder.
In the third step you must make sure that there are “boards.txt”, and “platform.txt”, inside the esp32 folder. In order to compile the ESP32 code, we also need the Xtensa GNU compiler (GCC) group.
